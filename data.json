  "short_info": "<p>Gardner Steel Conference Center (GSCC) was built from 1911-1912 by the Pittsburgh architectural firm of Kienhel and Elliot. Now a University academic building, the site originally served as the Central Turnverein, a German-American social and athletic association. Gardner Steel Conference Center is a contributing property to the Schenley Farms National Historic District, a significant example of early 20th century planned residential and civic development. </p>",
  "long_info": "<p>In many ways German-speaking immigrants shaped the physical and social landscape of Pittsburgh. The majority of diverse people who were held together by a shared German language migrated to Pittsburgh in the 19th century. German-speakers established religious, social, and financial institutions like Turnerein societies which served as both centers for exercise and social activity. The Gardner Steel Conference Center served as the site of one of many Turnerein societies in the city. Although cultural assimilation would gradually take a toll on membership in German-speaking institutions, many still endure in Pittsburgh today like the Teutonia Männerchor which has celebrated German song and dance for 150 years. </p><p><br /></p><p>Gardner Steel Conference Center was designed by German-born architect Richard Kiehnel. It stands out for its ornamental details over the entrance doors and cornice which were inspired by the German art nouveau movement, called “jugendstil.” As a part of the Schenley Farms National Historic District, the building adds to the historical significance and architectural integrity of the district. The area that creates the district was largely designed by F.F. Nicola in 1905 as a “model city” that combined a residential enslave adjacent to monumental civic buildings. The district contains buildings that were constructed by prominent Pittsburgh architects in international styles. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Further reading: </strong>Michael Shaunghnessy, <em>German Pittsburgh </em>(Arcadia Pub, 2007); Christina Mann, \"National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form: Schenley Farms Historic District\"</p>",
